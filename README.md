## 1. Abstract

Eating is a part of daily life for all people. We need food to keep our minds and bodies alive and when life gets busy with work, family, school, and other life events finding time to schedule what meals you will eat on what days and what ingredients you need for those can be a big time commitment. This can cause people to skip meals or stop at fast food restaurants due to a lack of organization and time. These both are unhealthy. The idea of the “**Dinner Planner**” is to allow people to mitigate the time-consuming, and sometimes stress-inducing process of meal planning and grocery shopping. The user will be able to add the meal of choice to the day they want to plan it and add the items needed for that meal. The App then will plan the meal for the user and add the items to their list. This will help organize the user's life in an area that gets neglected at times. Food has a big impact on health and allows users to organize and plan what they eat and when can allow them to make better choices for their health.

Life can get busy pressuring people to make bad eating habits that can affect health negatively. Most people now have mobile devices allowing for the process of organizing their lives to be much easier and less time-consuming. If the user has one of these devices, they will be able to plan their meals and groceries whenever the get the chance so they do not have to make last-minute decisions. After installing “**Dinner Planner**” users will be able to see a calendar of the current week as well as a place to schedule a meal for all seven days of any week.  The users will be able to add or remove custom recipes to the list of possible recipes to schedule.  One recipe can be placed per day in order to plan the upcoming meals.
