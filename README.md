## 1. Abstract

Eating is a part of daily life for all people. We need food to keep our minds and bodies alive. Life is busy with work, family, school, and other life events. Finding time to schedule what meals you will eat on what days and what ingredients you need for those can be a big time commitment. This can cause people to skip meals or stop at fast food restaurants due to a lack of organization and time. These both are unhealthy. The idea of the “**Dinner Planner**” is to allow people to mitigate the time-consuming, and sometimes stress-inducing process of meal planning and grocery shopping. The user will be able to add the meal of choice to the day they want to plan it and add the items needed for that meal. The App then will plan the meal for the user and add the items to their list. This will help organize the user's life in an area that gets neglected at times. Food has a big impact on health and allows users to organize and plan what they eat and when can allow them to make better choices for their health. 

## 2. Introduction

Flutter allows for the making of mobile applications that can be used on both Android and IOS. Most people today have a mobile device that has one of these operating systems. This allows for “**Dinner Planner**” to reach most people. Life can get busy pressuring people to make bad eating habits that can affect health negatively. Most people now have mobile devices, either Android or IOS, allowing for the process of organizing their lives to be much easier and less time-consuming. If the user has one of these devices, they will be able to plan their meals and groceries before the week even starts so they have a head start in the next week ahead and do not have to make last-minute decisions. After installing “**Dinner Planner**” users will be able to see a calendar of the current week as well as a place to schedule a meal for all seven days of the week. They will be able to add meals and remove meals from any desired day. On another page, they will see a list of groceries they will need to make for the meal if they decide to enter the items when scheduling the meal. The User will be able to remove and add to this list as well.
